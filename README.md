High-performance Unicode and Punycode encoding/decoding for internationalized domain names (IDNs) in R.

## Overview

The `punycoder` package provides fast, standards-based conversion between Unicode and ASCII representations of domain names, across two distinct surfaces:

- a **low-level Punycode codec** — `puny_encode()` / `puny_decode()` — the raw RFC 3492 transform with `xn--` A-label framing (RFC 5890/5891) and letter-digit-hyphen checks, **not** an IDNA normalization API (no Unicode NFC, UTS \#46 mapping, or case folding);
- an **IDNA/UTS-46 host-normalization surface** — `host_normalize()` — mapping a host name to its canonical lowercase ASCII comparison form under a pinned UTS \#46 non-transitional profile.

`host_normalize()` is a **UTS \#46 profile, not IDNA2008 conformance** — UTS \#46 is compatibility processing and deliberately accepts labels IDNA2008 would reject (e.g. `☕.example` → `xn--53h.example`). See `?host_normalize` and `normalization_profile_info()` for the normative profile and full standards references (RFC 3492/5890/5891/5892/5893, UTS \#46, UAX \#15/#44, STD 3, RFC 8753).

Normalization runs against vendored Unicode data, and a build ships a *set* of Unicode versions with one pinned as the default (currently 17.0.0, with 16.0.0 also shipped). `unicode_versions()` reports what the installed build carries, and `host_normalize(x, unicode_version = "16.0.0")` selects another one for a single call — which `normalization_profile_info()` reflects by appending `+unicode-<version>` to the reported profile token.

## Dependencies

`punycoder` has a small dependency footprint:

- Runtime dependencies: `R (>= 3.5.0)`, `Rcpp`
- Optional system dependency: `libidn2` (detected at compile time)
- Optional build helper: `pkg-config` (used by `configure` to detect `libidn2`)
- Development dependencies: `testthat`, `knitr`, `rmarkdown`

## Installation

Install the released version of punycoder from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=punycoder) with:

``` r
install.packages("punycoder")
```

Or install the development version from
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/bart-turczynski/punycoder) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_gitlab("bart-turczynski/punycoder")
```

### Optional native backend (`libidn2`)

`punycoder` works without extra system libraries. If `libidn2` is available at
build time, the package enables a native backend automatically; otherwise it
uses the built-in C++ fallback backend.

To install the recommended optional dependency:

- macOS (Homebrew):
  - `brew install libidn2 pkg-config`
- Debian/Ubuntu:
  - `sudo apt-get install libidn2-0-dev pkg-config`
- Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:
  - `sudo dnf install libidn2-devel pkgconf-pkg-config`
- Arch Linux:
  - `sudo pacman -S libidn2 pkgconf`

Verify the library is visible before installing `punycoder` from source:

``` r
system("pkg-config --modversion libidn2")
```

Then install/reinstall `punycoder`:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab("bart-turczynski/punycoder")
```

## Example

``` r
library(punycoder)

# Basic encoding
puny_encode("café.com")
#> [1] "xn--caf-dma.com"

# Check if domain is punycode
is_punycode("xn--example")
#> [1] TRUE

# Validate domains
validate_domain("test.com")
#> Punycoder Domain Validation Results
#> ==================================
#> 
#> 1 domain: 1 valid, 0 invalid (strict = TRUE)
#> 
#> Domain: test.com 
#> Valid:  TRUE
```

### Command-line use

`punycoder` is a library, not a CLI, but a one-line `Rscript` wrapper covers the
usual shell need: turning an IDN into the ASCII form that `dig`, `nslookup`, or
`curl` will actually accept. No extra install, no `bin/` script. The snippets
below are POSIX `sh`/`bash` — keep the `-e` argument in single quotes so the
shell leaves the R code alone.

Unicode host → ASCII, via the UTS \#46 canonical form:

``` sh
Rscript -e 'cat(punycoder::host_normalize(commandArgs(TRUE)), sep = "\n")' münchen.de
#> xn--mnchen-3ya.de
```

Use `puny_encode()` instead when you want the raw RFC 3492 transform with no
UTS \#46 mapping, and `puny_decode()` to go back the other way:

``` sh
Rscript -e 'cat(punycoder::puny_encode(commandArgs(TRUE)), sep = "\n")' münchen.de
#> xn--mnchen-3ya.de

Rscript -e 'cat(punycoder::puny_decode(commandArgs(TRUE)), sep = "\n")' xn--mnchen-3ya.de
#> münchen.de
```

Feeding a resolver is then just command substitution (drop `sep` so nothing but
the host is printed):

``` sh
dig +short "$(Rscript -e 'cat(punycoder::host_normalize(commandArgs(TRUE)))' münchen.de)"
#> 194.246.166.100

nslookup "$(Rscript -e 'cat(punycoder::host_normalize(commandArgs(TRUE)))' münchen.de)"
```

All three functions are vectorized, so several hosts can go through one R
startup and out to `xargs`:

``` sh
Rscript -e 'cat(punycoder::host_normalize(commandArgs(TRUE)), sep = "\n")' münchen.de москва.рф |
  xargs -n 1 dig +short
```

#### Failed conversions

`host_normalize()` never aborts: an input it cannot normalize comes back as
`NA`, which prints as a literal `NA` line rather than silently disappearing from
the pipeline.

``` sh
Rscript -e 'cat(punycoder::host_normalize(commandArgs(TRUE)), sep = "\n")' münchen.de 'bad..domain'
#> xn--mnchen-3ya.de
#> NA
```

`puny_encode()` and `puny_decode()` behave differently: they are strict by
default, so a bad input stops the script with a non-zero exit status.

``` sh
Rscript -e 'cat(punycoder::puny_encode(commandArgs(TRUE)), sep = "\n")' 'bad..domain'
#> Error: Error encoding domain: Domain contains empty label
#> Execution halted
```

Pass `strict = FALSE` to get the per-element `NA` behavior instead, so one bad
host does not take down a batch:

``` sh
Rscript -e 'cat(punycoder::puny_encode(commandArgs(TRUE), strict = FALSE), sep = "\n")' münchen.de 'bad..domain'
#> xn--mnchen-3ya.de
#> NA
```

Since `NA` is printed, not swallowed, drop it before piping to a resolver —
otherwise `dig` dutifully looks up a host named `NA`:

``` sh
Rscript -e 'h <- punycoder::host_normalize(commandArgs(TRUE)); cat(h[!is.na(h)], sep = "\n")' münchen.de 'bad..domain' |
  xargs -n 1 dig +short
```

## Key Features

- **Reliable Encoding/Decoding**: RFC 3492 compliant punycode conversion
- **High Performance**: Vectorized operations for processing large datasets
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Robust error handling with informative messages
- **Flexible Backend**: Automatically uses `libidn2` when available, with a built-in fallback backend

## Use Cases

### Data Analysis

Clean and standardize URL datasets:

``` r
# Identify international domains
is_idn(c("café.com", "example.com", "москва.рф"))

# Validate domain names
validate_domain(c("valid.com", "invalid..domain"))
```

## Current State

`punycoder` currently provides:

- Low-level Punycode codec: `puny_encode()`, `puny_decode()`
- IDNA/UTS-46 host normalization: `host_normalize()`, `normalization_profile_info()`, `unicode_versions()`
- Domain validation utilities: `is_punycode()`, `is_idn()`, `validate_domain()`
- Vectorized operations and strict/non-strict handling for malformed input
- Build-time backend selection (`libidn2` when present, built-in fallback otherwise)
- Best-effort structured host extraction where invalid inputs are returned as missing components

## Non-goals

`punycoder` is a standards primitive for Punycode and host normalization. It is
deliberately agnostic about resolvability and safety; the following are **not**
part of its acceptance criteria:

- **No spoof / homograph / mixed-script / display-safety detection.**
  `host_normalize()` is not a safety gate — a successful result says the host is
  valid and normalized under the pinned UTS \#46 profile, nothing about whether it
  is visually safe or non-deceptive. Confusable and restriction-level checks
  (UTS \#39 / UTR \#36, which UTS \#46 itself recommends only as application/UI-layer
  steps) belong upstack.
- **No URL parsing or canonicalization.** RFC 3986 / WHATWG URL parsing and
  canonicalization belong upstack; see the `rurl` package, which consumes
  punycoder’s host functions.
- **No DNS resolvability or registrability / PSL classification.**
- **No address parsing.** There is no `email`-to-ASCII helper; splitting an
  address and IDNA-encoding its domain part is an addressing concern for an
  upstack consumer, not a Punycode primitive.
- **No per-TLD repertoire / allowed-character validation.** `host_normalize()`
  validates against the pinned UTS \#46 profile, not against registry-specific
  IDN tables (which evolve independently of Unicode). TLD policy belongs upstack.

These opinions belong in higher layers that consume punycoder’s host functions.

## Prior art and comparison

Punycode/IDN libraries exist in most ecosystems. `punycoder` is most directly a
maintained, IDNA2008-era successor to the libidn-based R tooling — its public
API (`puny_encode()` / `puny_decode()` / `is_punycode()`) descends from
[`hrbrmstr/punycode`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/punycode). The table below
situates it against representative libraries.

|  | **punycoder** (R) | [hrbrmstr/punycode](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/punycode) (R) | [punycoder](https://pub.dev/packages/punycoder) (Dart) | [simonmittag/punycoder](https://github.com/simonmittag/punycoder) (Go) |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Form | library | library | library | CLI tool |
| RFC 3492 codec | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Engine | `libidn2` + in-tree fallback | GNU `libidn` | pure Dart | Go `x/net/idna` |
| IDNA standard | 2008 / UTS #46 (non-transitional) | 2003 (nameprep) | RFC 3492 + IDNA helpers | UTS #46 (via `x/net`) |
| Unicode NFC | explicit (UAX #15) | implicit in nameprep | not documented | via `x/net` |
| Pinned Unicode version | yes — 17.0.0, regenerable; 16.0.0 also selectable | no (frozen at build) | no | tracks Go release |
| CheckBidi / CheckJoiners | always on | not surfaced | not documented | partial |
| UTS #46 conformance corpus (`IdnaTestV2`) | yes — one per shipped Unicode version | no | no | — |
| Strict / `NA` per-element policy | yes | undocumented | `validate` flag | n/a (CLI) |
| Vectorized | yes | yes | n/a | n/a |
| Maintenance | active | last commit 2015 | maintained | maintained |

> The most consequential row is **IDNA standard**. IDNA2003 (GNU `libidn`,
> nameprep) and IDNA2008 / UTS #46 disagree on real domains: the *deviation
> characters* `ß`, `ς`, and the joiners ZWJ/ZWNJ. Under IDNA2003 `faß.de` is

> UTS #46 non-transitional profile preserves it as `xn--fa-hia.de`. A
> libidn-era pipeline therefore silently rewrites some hosts rather than
> erroring, which is the class of bug `punycoder` exists to remove.

### Observed behavior on the comparable R packages

Running the same inputs through the comparable R packages surfaces concrete
behavioral differences (observed against `punycode` 0.2.5, `urltools` 1.7.3.1,
and the author’s own upstack toolkit [`rurl`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rurl)
1.4.0). The raw RFC 3492 codec output agrees byte-for-byte across the codecs
once direction is aligned — the divergences are in multi-label handling,
idempotency, validity philosophy, and input scope. `rurl` is a URL
parser/normalizer rather than a Punycode codec; it is included to show where the
URL-shaped inputs `punycoder` deliberately rejects are actually handled (it
delegates IDNA host conversion to `punycoder`), so `—` below means “out of
scope for that layer,” not a defect:

| Behavior | **punycoder** | hrbrmstr/punycode | urltools | rurl |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Primary role | Punycode/IDNA host codec | Punycode codec (IDNA2003) | URL + punycode utilities | URL parser / normalizer |
| `puny_encode()` direction | Unicode → ASCII | **ASCII → Unicode** (names inverted) | Unicode → ASCII | — (no codec; IDNA via `punycoder`) |
| Decode multi-label `xn--hxakfddc2amo8b.xn--qxam` | `ελράδειγμα.ελ` ✓ | `ελράδειγμα.ελ` ✓ | `ελράδειγμα.ελράδειγμα` ✗ (second label corrupted) | — (no `xn--` → Unicode decoder) |
| Re-encode an already-`xn--` label | unchanged — idempotent ✓ | unchanged ✓ | `xn--xn--…-.xn--xn--…-` ✗ (double-encoded) | — |
| Round-trip `decode(encode(x)) == x` | yes | yes | no (from the decode bug above) | — |
| `gr€€n.no` — EURO SIGN, valid under UTS #46 | accepted → `xn--grn-l50aa.no` | rejected by `puny_tld_check` (IDNA2008) | — | parses; host preserved |
| Full-URL input (`http://…`) | rejected with an actionable error pointing at a URL parser (`rurl`) | n/a (domain-only) | passed through unchanged | **parsed** — scheme/host/domain/TLD extracted; `get_clean_url()` lowercases the host and resolves dot-segments |
| Required system library | none (`libidn2` optional) | GNU `libidn` (v1) required to build | none | none |

> `punycode` names its functions opposite to the usual convention:
> `punycode::puny_encode()` maps `xn--` → Unicode and
> `punycode::puny_decode()` maps Unicode → `xn--`. The rows above align
> by transform direction, not by function name.
>
> `punycoder` + `rurl` (+ [`pslr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pslr) for
> the public-suffix/TLD truth) are designed to compose: `rurl` parses the URL and
> hands the host to `punycoder` for IDNA canonicalization, each package owning a
> single concern.
