# Disposition machinery for the OSS Index dependency audit in
# test-security.R. The allow-list lives here rather than in the test file
# because more than one test block reads it -- the offline well-formedness
# check and the network audit itself.
#
# WHY A LIST THAT IS EMPTY. The contract this file implements is "every
# reported advisory has a current, explicit disposition", replacing "the scan
# reports nothing" (SEOR-fkvlzltx, deciding SEOR-feqgnbwt route (a); ported
# here under SEOR-fftbjnpl). For punycoder the two contracts coincide today:
# measured 2026-09-24 with live OSS Index credentials, the hard dependency
# closure reports zero advisories, so there is nothing to dispose of and the
# list is empty.
#
# Rows are deliberately NOT copied in from other repositories ahead of need
# (SEOR-sxvcbuia): rule B below fails a row that is not currently reported, so
# an anticipatory row is stale on arrival and would fail the gate on the day
# it is added. The machinery is what is portable; the rows are not. Adding one
# later is a one-block edit to `oss_index_allowlist`.
#
# Three rules keep the list honest. test-security.R enforces them:
#
#   A  UNEXPECTED  an advisory reported and not allow-listed FAILS. This is
#                  the gate still doing its job.
#   B  STALE       an allow-listed advisory NO LONGER reported FAILS. An
#                  allow-list may not over-permit; a row that has outlived its
#                  justification is deleted, not left to widen the exemption
#                  silently.
#   C  DRIFT       past its review date, or audited at a package version later
#                  than `version_seen`, a row WARNS. Deliberately not a
#                  failure: a calendar date that turns every push red is how a
#                  gate teaches people to reach for --no-verify.
#
# Adding a row is a decision, not a formality. Rule B is what keeps it one.
#
# The reference implementation, and the only rows in this fleet, are in
# `sitemapr/tests/testthat/helper-security.R`.
