# Conformance check for host_normalize against the official UTS #46 corpus
# IdnaTestV2.txt. Both tests below run once per SHIPPED Unicode version, each
# against the corpus Unicode published with that version -- pairing the 17.0.0
# engine with the 16.0.0 expectations would silently under-test both. We compare
# the non-transitional ToASCII column toAsciiN, which matches punycoder's pinned
# profile uts46-nontransitional-std3-v2. The parser and the per-version fixture
# path live in helper-idna.R; this file is ASCII-clean and all Unicode inputs
# come from the fixture.
#
# punycoder honors every UTS #46 validity flag, so under the strict v1 profile
# any status code means the row is expected to be rejected as NA. The single
# documented divergence is the trailing FQDN root dot: strict VerifyDnsLength
# flags the empty root label as A4_2, but host_normalize permits it, mapping a
# name such as example.com. to itself. CONTEXTO is not enforced and the corpus
# does not test it.

# The A4_2 root-dot deviation count, per corpus. It is a property of the
# vendored fixture (17.0.0 adds two more trailing-dot rows), not of the engine,
# so it cannot be a single number. Pinned so a regression in root-dot or length
# handling shifts it and trips here.

# Relaxing a UTS #46 flag must (1) never change a result the strict profile
# already accepts, and (2) only ever newly-accept rows whose remaining error
# codes are the ones that flag governs -- plus A4_2, the trailing-root-dot
# divergence host_normalize already tolerates under every profile. The corpus
# toAsciiN column carries the relaxed-accept output (e.g. "(4).four" under
# [U1]), so newly-accepted rows must equal it. CheckBidi / CheckJoiners are not
# knobs and are not exercised here.
#
# One documented exception: two xn-- rows carry [V2, V4]. V4 (a U-label that
# itself re-prefixes to xn--) is not one of the three exposed flags and is the
# only V4 in the corpus -- it never occurs without V2, so the strict profile
# always rejects via V2 and host_normalize has never enforced V4 independently.
# Relaxing CheckHyphens removes the V2 reason and these two slip through. This
# is out of B's scope (parameterize existing checks, not add new criteria) and
# is pinned here, exactly as the strict test pins its A4_2 root-dot divergences.
#
# Verified against both vendored corpora: the set is the same two rows under
# 16.0.0 and 17.0.0, so it is version-invariant and is deliberately NOT keyed by
# version -- a per-version list here would imply a variation that does not
# exist.
