# OSS Index dependency vulnerability audit (oysteR / Sonatype).
#
# `oysteR::audit_description()` resolves the installed DESCRIPTION and audits
# punycoder's hard dependencies against the Sonatype OSS Index. It is a
# network test that requires OSS Index credentials (OSSINDEX_USER /
# OSSINDEX_TOKEN): the API rejects unauthenticated requests with HTTP 401.
#
# Scope: hard dependencies only -- `Depends` + `Imports`, never `Suggests`.
#
# `oysteR::expect_secure()` audits `Depends` + `Imports` + `Suggests`, and
# `Suggests` drags in the recursive dependency trees of the dev tooling --
# including oysteR's own, which reaches `curl` through httr. So the gate was
# failing on a vulnerability in the auditor rather than in anything a user of
# punycoder installs.
#
# Measured 2026-09-10, same machine and credentials:
#
#     fields = Depends+Imports              3 packages audited, clean
#     fields = Depends+Imports+Suggests    78 packages audited, reports curl
#
# `curl` is absent from punycoder's hard dependency tree entirely. The two
# flagged advisories -- CVE-2026-18924 (CWE-416 use-after-free, CVSS 9.1) and
# CVE-2026-3783 (CWE-522 insufficiently protected credentials, CVSS 6.9) --
# both name libcurl ranges that include CRAN's current `curl` 8.0.0, so no
# available version clears them and no local action could make the old scope
# pass. PUNY-vymqxjnf carries the full measurement.
#
# A package's security posture is what it makes users install, so the audit
# calls `audit_description()` directly with the narrower `fields`.
# `expect_secure()` sets a CRAN mirror internally and `audit_description()`
# does not, hence the explicit `repos` option.
#
# The audit gates on dispositions, not on silence: every reported advisory
# must have a row in the allow-list in helper-security.R, and every row must
# still be reported (SEOR-fftbjnpl). The rules are documented there.
#
# WHERE THIS RUNS, AND WHY THE PRECONDITIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS SKIPS.
#
# Everywhere ordinary -- a local `testthat::test_local()`, the pre-push verify
# gate, a plain `R CMD check --as-cran` -- a missing precondition is a skip.
# That is right: a developer without OSS Index credentials is not a security
# regression.
#
# In the ONE place that exists to run this audit, it is not right. The
# `security-audit` CI job had no credentials (the GitHub repository secrets did
# not follow the move to GitLab), so `skip_if()` fired, the job reported
# success, and nothing had been audited (PUNY-rsxtbbln). A green job that
# audited nothing is worse than no job, because it answers the question it was
# never asked.
#
# So under OSSINDEX_AUDIT_REQUIRED=true every precondition below becomes a hard
# failure with a message naming what is missing. The flag is meant to be set
# in the `security-audit` job in `.gitlab-ci.yml` and nowhere else, so no other
# context changes behavior. As of this commit the job does NOT set it yet:
# that half of SEOR-fftbjnpl is deferred until the pending CI consolidation
# (MR !26, which rewrites `.gitlab-ci.yml`) merges. This file already honors
# the flag, so enabling the gate is a one-line variable in that job.
#
# NOTE ON THE PRE-PUSH HOOK. This repository's pre-push `verify` hook is inline
# R in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: `lintr::lint_package()`, then
# `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = "--as-cran", error_on = "warning")` with the
# default environment. Neither sets NOT_CRAN -- measured 2026-09-24 with
# testthat 3.3.2 and rcmdcheck 1.4.0, a probe test under `rcmdcheck()` saw
# NOT_CRAN empty and `skip_on_cran()` firing -- so the audit never runs on
# push, even though `~/.Renviron` puts the credentials in scope inside R. It
# runs under `testthat::test_local()`, which sets NOT_CRAN=true.
